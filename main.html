	<h1> We will delve deeper into Time and Space Complexity in Different Cases : </h1>

	<p>
		Time Complexity means amount of time required to run algorithm . When we solve 
		the real world problems then single problem can have multiple solutions ,
		but they vary based on their complexities i.e. time and space complexity 
		The Solution which is efficient we try to implement it to improve the overall performance of code .
		In this way , we approach the problem .
	</p>
	<p>
		Similarly for <b>Space Complexity</b> but before moving forward 
		let's try to understand the <b>Space Complexity</b> :
		amount of space consumed by algorithm while running the code .
		So <b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n) is generally considered as good .
