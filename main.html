	<h1>Time and Space Complexity </h1>

	<p>
		Time Complexity means amount of time required to run algorithm . When we solve 
		the real world problems then single problem can have multiple solutions ,
		but they vary based on their complexities . The Solution which is efficient we try to implement it to improve the overall performance of code .
		In this way , we approach the problem .
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>Space Complexity</b> means amount of space consumed by algorithm while running the code .
		O(n) is generally considered as good .
